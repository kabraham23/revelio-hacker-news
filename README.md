# Thank you!

## This is my submission for consideration for the front end position. 

### begin with the usual ```npm install``` and run with ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

### packages used are iconify, react-router-dom, and react-redux.

### some known differences from the mock-up are the font (there was not a universal way to attach Ubuntu), and the number of articles in the 'latest' component. Google News only allows 10 articles to be pulled at a time for the free token. This is also why the 'more' button is not given a function.
